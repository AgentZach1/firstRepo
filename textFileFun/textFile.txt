Filesystem Basic

The root of the linux filesystem is the /
The root of your local user filesytsem is your home
home is aka ~

pwd - print working directory

/home/dave/Documents/CS2505/examples/examples/C

Paths that start with a / are an absolute path

cp - means copy
cp takes a source and a destination

cp source destination

example

cp io.c ~/Documents
	copy io.c from here to the home documents
	
. or ./ is the current directory, or here, right here

../ is the parent of this directory

/home/dave/Documents/CS2505/examples/examples/

====================
-or
====================
will move you up a level

====================

====================

Documents/CS2505/examples/examples/

paths that do not begin with a / are relative paths
they might start with ./
./Documents/CS2505/examples/examples/


ls - list the contents of a directory

ls destination

mv - moves a file from source to destination

let's pretend we have a file name file.txt in our cwd (current
working directory)

mv file.txt ~/Documents/my-file.txt
moves file to documents AND renames it to my-file.txt 

mv file.txt ~/Documents it would move file and keep the same name

	
Filenames and directory names should not have spaces in them

Extensions


mkdir - make directory

mkdir name

rmdir - removes a directory

rmdir name

up and down arrows will scroll through your command history

File Permissions

All Linux files (and directories) have 3 sets of permissions

You the user is a group        - u
There is a group getting       - g
And others is the last setting - o

read permissions    - r 
write permission    - w 
execute permission  - x
 r w x 
 0 0 1 - 1
 0 1 0 - 2
 1 0 0 - 4
 0 0 0 - 0
 
 
 chmod o-r L02.txt
 chmod o+w L02.txt
 
 chmod go-r L02.txt
 
 chmod 700 L02.txt
 
 chmod or change modifiers is additive
